# HMG
HMG is a highly customizable random pokemon generator for Pokemon Showdown/PKHeX

Long long ago (2014), I started a project in my highschool programming class. It gave me so much trouble as a young coder (probably because I picked python of all languages) that I affectionately named it High Maintenance Girlfriend (HMG). It is entirely written in python as stated before, and I have no intention of changing that. I haven't touched the code in at least 3 years as of the time of me writing this (5-14-25), but I want to finish it if it kills me. When it started this was a simple way for me to have a randomly generated pokemon spit out for me to do a solo run with. Now I intend for this to be a whole team of six with random, but leagal, moves, abilities, EV's, IV's, natures, and items. All in Showdown format, ready to copy and paste into the team editor. I don't know why I want this, and I don't know if this will ever be usefull to anyone, but in the event that it is, I am going to be uploading everything here for you to use and edit as you please. Who knows, maybe one day this will be the base for some other passion project.
